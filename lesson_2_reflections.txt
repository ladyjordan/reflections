What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When a repository is initialized using git init command, we get a .git folder(basically meta
	data) that saves a history of various versions of the project. A normal directory doesn't have 
	such meta data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  	
  	working directory has untracked changes whereas staging area has tracked changes 
  	that are ready to be commited. Staging area is an intermediate between the working 
  	directory and the repository.
